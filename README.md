Flux is a communication-overlapping library for dense/MoE models on GPUs, providing high-performance and pluggable kernels to support various parallelisms in model training/inference.

Flux's efficient kernels are compatible with Pytorch and can be integrated into existing frameworks easily, supporting various Nvidia GPU architectures and data types.

# News
[2025/03/10]ðŸ”¥We have released **COMET: Computation-communication Overlapping for Mixture-of-Experts**.


## Getting started
Install Flux from source.

### Install from Source
```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/bytedance/flux.git && cd flux

# Install dependencies
bash ./install_deps.sh

# For Ampere(sm80) GPU
./build.sh --arch 80 --nvshmem
# For Ada Lovelace(sm89) GPU
./build.sh --arch 89 --nvshmem
# For Hopper(sm90) GPU
./build.sh --arch 90 --nvshmem
```

#### Install in a virtual environment
Here is a snippet to install Flux in a virtual environment. Let's finish the installation in an virtual environment with CUDA 12.4, torch 2.6.0 and python 3.11.

```bash
conda create -n flux python=3.11
conda activate flux
pip3 install packaging
pip3 install ninja
pip3 install torch==2.6.0 torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124

./build.sh --clean-all
./build.sh --arch "80;89;90" --nvshmem --package
```

Then you would expect a wheel package under `dist/` folder that is suitable for your virtual environment.

### Customized Installation
#### Build options for source installation

1. Add `--nvshmem` to build Flux with NVSHMEM support. It is essential for the MoE kernels.
2. If you are tired of the cmake process, you can set environment variable `FLUX_BUILD_SKIP_CMAKE` to 1 to skip cmake if `build/CMakeCache.txt` already exists.
3. If you want to build a wheel package, add `--package` to the build command. find the output wheel file under dist/


#### Dependencies
The core dependencies of Flux are NCCL, CUTLASS, and NVSHMEM, which are located under the 3rdparty folder.
1. NCCL: Managed by git submodule automatically.
2. NVSHMEM: Downloaded from https://developer.nvidia.com/nvshmem. The current version is 3.2.5-1.
3. CUTLASS: Flux leverages CUTLASS to generate high-performance GEMM kernels. We currently use CUTLASS 3.7.0 and a tiny patch is applied to CUTLASS.


## Quick Start

Below are commands to run some basic demos once you have installed Flux successfully.
```bash
# gemm only
python3 test/python/gemm_only/test_gemm_only.py 4096 12288 6144 --dtype=float16

# all-gather fused with gemm (dense MLP layer0)
./launch.sh test/python/ag_gemm/test_ag_kernel.py 4096 49152 12288 --dtype=float16 --iters=10

# gemm fused with reduce-scatter (dense MLP layer1)
./launch.sh test/python/gemm_rs/test_gemm_rs.py 4096 12288 49152 --dtype=float16 --iters=10

# all-gather fused with grouped gemm (MoE MLP layer0)
./launch.sh test/python/moe_ag_scatter/test_moe_ag.py

# grouped gemm fused with reduce-scatter (MoE MLP layer1)
./launch.sh test/python/moe_gather_rs/test_moe_gather_rs.py
```

You can check out the documentations for more details!

* For a more detailed usage on MoE kernels, please refer to [Flux MoE Usage](https://github.com/bytedance/flux/blob/main/docs/moe_usage.md). Try some [examples](https://github.com/bytedance/flux/blob/main/examples) as a quick start. A [minimal MoE layer](https://github.com/bytedance/flux/blob/main/examples/moe_flux_only.py) can be implemented within only a few tens of lines of code using Flux!
* For some performance numbers, please refer to [Performance Doc](https://github.com/bytedance/flux/blob/main/docs/performance.md).
