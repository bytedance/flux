NVSHMEM is a parallel programming interface based on OpenSHMEM
that provides efficient and scalable communication for NVIDIA GPU
clusters. NVSHMEM creates a global address space for data that spans
the memory of multiple GPUs and can be accessed with fine-grained
GPU-initiated operations, CPU-initiated operations, and operations
on CUDA(R) streams.
