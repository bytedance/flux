/*
 * Stateless universal device GEMM kernel type that treats GEMM as
 * a composition of a collective mainloop and a collective epilogue.
 *
 * Supports both the 2.x and 3.x APIs based on whether the first type is
 * a cute::tuple<> or not.
 * 2.x API implementation: cutlass/gemm/kernel/gemm_universal.h
 * 3.x API implementation: cutlass/gemm/kernel/gemm_*.hpp
 *
 * In the following declaration, the name preceding the 'Or' refers to
 * 3.x API type argument order, and the name succeeding the 'Or' refers to
 * 2.x API type argument order. Template arguments without two names
 * belong to the 3.x API only.
